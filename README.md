## Researches

I defined the project and created a roadmap that I put on [Github project](https://github.com/junkiesan/s-test/projects/1).
Here you will find every tickets I realized and thought about. They are linked to issues, themselves linked to pull requests. Even though I worked alone, I tried to contribute to this project as if I was in a team.
